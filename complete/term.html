<p>If you have any special requests like meal preference, Seat Allocation and wheel chair request etc, please advise us at time of issuance of ticket. We will try our best to fulfill these by passing this request to relevant airline but we cannot guarantee and failure to meet any special request will not held us liable for any claim.</p>

                                    Any change to an itinerary prior to  receipt of your final payment will be treated as an amendment. <br>
                                    Depending on the amount of work involved,  each change/amendment will incur a charge which will not exceed Â£50 per person  in addition to any further costs or charges that we incur from our suppliers in  making the alteration considering that the airline/supplier rules/policy  permits the requested change. <br>
                                    If full payment has already been received  amendments may not be permitted in the airline policy, under these  circumstances, amendments can be treated as cancellations and the cancellation  charges detailed below will apply. However, generally cancellations are  entirely non-refundable (unless specified). <br>
                                    Please note that most suppliers, in  particular airlines do not allow a name change / date change or any changes and  may consider this as a cancellation with a 100% cancellation charge (where  ticket is not utilized as originally issued). </p>

                                <p>Reservations are entirely non-changeable,  non-transferable and non-refundable, unless specified. However; Changes before  ticket issuance are regulated both in accordance with airline policy and  company policy and should be discussed with the concerned agent as rules may  vary depending on carrier/supplier. Changes cannot be guaranteed and will  depend on availability of seats/fares and classes. Also, Changes incur cost  differences / penalty. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Once a change is requested by the traveler, any previous/existing reservation  and fares are dissolved to make changes and therefore, if a traveler chooses to  retreat, it is not possible to offer the same previous fare again, or  older/previous reservation or seats on previously given/reserved date. Hence in  that case, any fare difference, charges or penalty will apply accordingly to return  to reservation on original data. In cases where the difference is not paid or  agreed by the traveler; yet the change has been ordered, the reservation will  be treated as cancellation by traveler (Refer "changes after ticket / voucher issuance") and cancellation charges will be  payable/deducted. </p>

                                <p>Please note as airlines strictly do not  permit name changes at any stage, if you require a name change prior ticket  issuance; it can be done only through re-booking of seats. As we are seller of  special and promotional fares available for short duration and few seats only,  it is possible that upon rebooking (for name change) same fare, same dates or  prices are not available. Under these circumstances any fare / cost difference  as applicable, will be payable by the traveler. Fares are constantly changing  and mostly raising, therefore any fare/tax difference as applicable on date of  name change / rebooking will be charged accordingly and payable by the  traveler. However, if the difference is not accepted or paid, the reservation  will be subjected to regulations as stated in section &nbsp;headed "cancellation by traveler". </p>

Tickets  returned will be submitted to the respective airline, or their agent, for  assessment. <br>
                                    As soon as we are reimbursed by the issuing airline or their agent  we will forward a refund to you, less loss of deposit, applicable cancellation  and/or administration charges. Please note that airline refunds on part used  tickets and the return half of the airfare are always less than the pro-rata  rate and may have no refund value whatsoever. Refunds usually take 8 - 12 weeks  but in certain cases may take longer or indefinite period such as Airline Bankruptcies.  Please note, airlines are directly in control of refund matters, refund amount  or refund date and the agency is only a communication channel, hence bears no  responsibility for delays or differentials or airline actions. <br>
                                    Cancellation has to be applied within a certain period (24 hours  to 7 days) and after a given periods cancellation may not be refunded or  entertained. Also, documents, airline letters, passport or ticket copies /  scans can be demanded to apply cancellations. <br>
                                    Any other cost/damage claims or any other amount other than the  cost of tickets / paid value to the agency cannot be claimed through or by  agency and has to be claimed directly from the airline.

Ticket costs/damages/ accommodation vouchers value etc are to be  claimed form the airline/hotel directly under any and all circumstances.  However, the agency will provide guideline, support and follow-up if required  for the "exact amount paid' claims. </p>

                                        <li>Email reply by clients is just a secondary step taken as precaution to avoid agent mistakes and is not a requirement to be considered as an agreement by client.

Verification of the exact amount (in pounds and penne) should be in written and replied back with the same email confirming the details of the flights/holidays package. Flight cancellation by system or fare expiry due to delay caused by such failure to meet this standard security check will fall under breach by you.</li>

Through deposit one ensures the availability  whereas the cost may vary pertaining to the fluctuations in airline policies,  pricings, tax and currency. The airline reserves the right to revise costing  unless the tickets are issued. Whereas schedules may also be revised  after/before the tickets are issued. All passengers should check flight  schedules 72/48 hours prior departure of flight (both out bound and inbound) by  calling airline and final payments are determined after recheck of airline  policy and pricing as at the date of final payment or full payment. </p>

It is therefore to your advantage to finalize payment as soon as you can, after making your reservation. </li>
                                        <li>If full payment is accepted at the time of booking, the deposit will be deemed to have been included. </li>

                                        <li>Your tickets will show the pre-paid taxes known at the time of booking. If any Government Body, Airport Authority or Airline increases or introduces a tax this will have to be paid on occasion, even if it is after your tickets have been issued and the agency is not liable or accountable for any such increases/introduced charges. If your flight is part of a package please see 'your holiday price' in Part 2. </li>
                                        <li>It is not always possible to include all departure taxes on your ticket - in some cases departure taxes must be paid locally and these are payable to the Government of the country departed and are non-refundable.

OR once you confirm and meet all  requirements as mailed/communicated to you at time of reservation, considering  the full payment is made and confirmed, the tickets/vouchers are issued and  e-mailed ASAP (mostly 24 hours). In peak times this may not be the case. No  tickets will be sent out unless final payment has been received and cleared.  Travel documents (e-tickets / vouchers) will be sent on email as attachments  and should be printed out or collected from our offices. In rare cases, where  documents are specially required in post, they will be sent by Royal Mail  Services (charges apply).

However because travel arrangements are often made many months in advance and because we have no control over some of the products featured in this brochure changes and cancellations may occasionally be necessary. We reserve the right to make changes or cancel your travel arrangements in any circumstances and at any time (Notification will be given). A change may be "major" or "minor". A major change would be considered to be a change in accommodation to a lower standard, or to a different resort, or the cancellation of a tour, a rescheduling of your flight departure time by more than 12 hours, or a change of your departing airport (excluding a change between Heathrow or Gatwick or an airport which is more convenient to you). We reserve the right to make a minor change and we will tell you as soon as possible. If there is a major change to your travel arrangements we will inform you as soon as is reasonably possible.

In the unlikely event that a tour is cancelled due to low bookings you will be told as soon as is practical. If we are unable to provide you with a significant element of the package after you have departed we will make alternative arrangements for you at no extra charge. Package bookings are not cancelled less than 8 weeks prior to departure unless in cases of "Force Majeure" or failure to pay your balance on the specified date. This means that we will not have to pay compensation if we have to cancel or change your travel arrangements in any way because of war, riot, industrial dispute, terrorist activity, natural or nuclear disaster, fire, adverse weather conditions, unforeseen operational decisions of air carriers such as changes of schedule, or other unforeseen or unavoidable circumstances beyond our control. If the cancellation has not been caused by force majeure or low bookings we will pay you compensation as set out below: (Period before departure within which a major change is notified to you); followed by: Compensation per person: more than 56 days - Nil; 55-29 days- '10; 28 days or less - '20. </li>

                                        <li>The price of your travel arrangements can be varied due to changes in transportation costs such as fuel, scheduled airfares and any other airline cost changes which are part of the contract between airlines (and their agents) and the tour operator or organizer. Also government action such as changes in VAT or any other government imposed changes and currency changes in relation to an exchange rate variation. In the case of any small variation, an amount equivalent to 2% of the price of your travel arrangements, which excludes insurance premiums and any amendment charges, will be absorbed or retained. For larger variations this 2% will still be absorbed for increases but not retained from refunds. In either case there will be an administration charge of '1.00 per person. If this means that you have to pay an increase of more than 15% of the price of your travel arrangements, you may cancel your travel arrangements and receive a full refund of all monies paid, except for any amendment charges. We will consider an appropriate refund of insurance premiums paid if you can show that you are unable to transfer or reuse your policy. Should you decide to cancel for this reason, you must exercise your right to do so within 14 days from the issue date printed on your final invoice. Whether you cancel or not you will also be entitled, on the terms set out in respect of major changes, to accept an offer of alternative travel arrangements from us if we are able to do so and compensation as indicated. Please note that travel arrangements are not always purchased in local currency and some apparent changes have no impact on the price of your travel due to contractual and other protection in place. </li>
